# CS 228 (Fall 2019)
This course served as an introduction to data structures. I found the projects to be fairly beneficial to my understanding of OOP (object oriented programming). There were only 3 projects / homework assignments, so each project was pretty time consuming and challenging.

###### Homework 1
The first homework assignment was to read in data from a NOAA weather file. From this file, we were to find the average, median, max, min (etc) of the days worth of data within the file. This served as an introduction to Java generics for me, as I had never seen them before.

###### Homework 2
This was more of a project as I needed to implement an "amusing" linked list. This linked list had a few special traits in addition to what a normal linked list would have (mainly changing where each node is pointing). We also had to implement a sort of queue or "deque." This deque was to store "amusing precise numbers" that we could perform calculations on. This project got us pretty heavily invested into some common data storage models.

###### Homework 3
The last project was a sort of game. We were all to play against computer AI in a sort of space colinization game. The biggest thing we worked with here was a graph data structure. Many different planents were connected by edges in no particular pattern. The end goal of the game was to have visited as many planets as possible (or at least, more than the computer AI). This got us pretty heavily invested in tracking the nodes of a tree and finding optimal strategies to traverse the tree (such as Dijkstra's).
